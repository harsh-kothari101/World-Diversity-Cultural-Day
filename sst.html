                Water is a source of life, energy, and absolution in religions 
                and communities around the world. Temples, cities, and even empires
                have been built around water, and from Christianity to Hinduism to 
                the Nigerian Yoruba religion, rivers have always played an especially 
                important role in worshippers lives. Unfortunately today, many of 
                these important rivers have been polluted and sacred sites destroyed
                by industrialization and urban waste. Yet despite the destruction, 
                many modern pilgrims still travel to them to find guidance, mercy, 
                or a final resting place.
